Introduction
============

RL-analytics is a Python package containging two gyms for Reinforcement Learning agents training.
Both gyms are in the domain of water systems namely - the controlling of Hydraulic Pumps (pump gym)
and the controlling of a simple Water Distribution Tank system with a single Valve.

Motivation
**********

Our main motivation has been the lack of existing environments(gyms) for training agents on
control problems in Water Distribution networks and systems.

Limitations
***********

Capturing the full complexity of a WDS(Water Distribution System) is not captured by any of the two gyms,
but hopefully, in the future we will be able to create a full-fledged Water Gym , combining both the control
over pumps and valves, as well as other control actions.
